    <p id="pInstruction">The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower and sometimes pluralized as Towers) is a
      mathematical game or puzzle.  It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide
      onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest
      at the top, thus making a conical shape. </p>

     <p id="pInstruction">The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 
      Only one disk can be moved at a time.
      Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an
      empty rod. 
     No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. 
      With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi
      puzzle is 2n − 1, where n is the number of disks </p>
      <p id="pInstruction">A simple solution for the toy puzzle is to alternate moves between the smallest piece and a non-smallest piece. 
      When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the 
      starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd). If there is no tower 
      position in the chosen direction, move the piece to the opposite end, but then continue to move in the correct 
      direction. For example, if you started with three pieces, you would move the smallest piece to the opposite end,
      then continue in the left direction after that. When the turn is to move the non-smallest piece, there is only one 
      legal move. Doing this will complete the puzzle in the fewest moves. </p> 
    
    <h2 id="h2Instruction">Simpler statement of iterative solution</h2>
    <h4>For an even number of disks: </h4>

    <p id="pInstruction">  
     <ul>
         <li> make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction),</li>
        <li> make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction),</li>
        <li>make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction), </li>
        <li>repeat until complete.</li> 
      </ul>
  
    <h4> For an odd number of disks:</h4>
    
      <ul> 
        <li>make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction),</li>
       <li> make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction),</li> 
       <li> make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction),</li> 
       <li>repeat until complete.</li> 
      </ul>
    </p>
     <p id="pInstruction"> In each case, a total of 2n − 1 moves are made.</p>
    <h2 id="h2Instruction">Equivalent iterative solution</h2>
    <p id="pInstruction">Another way to generate the unique optimal iterative solution: 
      <ul>
        <li> Number the disks 1 through n (largest to smallest).</li> 
        <li> Number the disks 1 through n (largest to smallest).</li>  
        <li> If n is odd, the first move is from peg A to peg </li>
        <li>If n is even, the first move is from peg A to peg </li>
      
        <li>Now, add these constraints: </li> 

        <li> No odd disk may be placed directly on an odd disk.</li>  
        <li>  No even disk may be placed directly on an even disk. </li>
        <li>here will sometimes be two possible pegs: one will have disks,  and the other will be empty. Place the disk on the
            non-empty peg.</li>  
        <li> Never move a disk twice in succession. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
      
    <p id="pInstruction"> Considering those constraints after the first move, there is only one legal move at every subsequent turn. 

      The sequence of these unique moves is an optimal solution to the problem equivalent to the iterative solution 
      described above</p>
